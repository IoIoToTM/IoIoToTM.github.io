It was created solely by me, and is inspired by games like &amp;ldquo;I Expect You To Die&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Stanley Parable&amp;rdquo; - the voice you hear in your ear is supposed to be the thing that agents hear when they&amp;rsquo;re on a mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mechanic itself, slowing down time and being shot by bullets is close to what &amp;ldquo;Super Hot&amp;rdquo; does, but I went for a more controlled slow down by pressing a button and having limited time to do that. You have to take bullets that you&amp;rsquo;ve frozen in time and try to make the shoot the targets.
To download it an try it (it&amp;rsquo;s only for VR and it&amp;rsquo;s tested only on the Vive controllers), check out &lt;a href="https://ioiototm.itch.io/008-vr-extravaganza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ioiototm.itch.io/008-vr-extravaganza&lt;/a>, where there&amp;rsquo;s also a link to a video of the game being played.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bingo Bongo</title><link>https://ioiototm.github.io/project/games/comp3218/bingo-bongo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ioiototm.github.io/project/games/comp3218/bingo-bongo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This game is a local co-op multiplayer in the theme of Ying-Yang (hence the name). It was created by my friend and me for the first coursework, &amp;ldquo;Tutorial&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be played by two people on the same keyboard, and each player controls either the white or black rectangle, which have special abilities that have to be used to help the other player complete the level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can download the game and check some more screenshot on my itch.io page for the game at &lt;a href="https://ioiototm.itch.io/bingo-bongo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ioiototm.itch.io/bingo-bongo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

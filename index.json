As having multiple VR headsets is out of reach to the average consumer, we need to look into different possible ways of including multiple people in this play space. We have created a multi-modal co-located multiplayer VR game, Stuck in Space, that introduces a second player in two ways - one with a PC (the baseline that a lot of current games do), as well as a tracked Phone that can be used as a `window into the virtual world'. We have conducted a user study (n = 24) where we explore the difference in immersion and co-presence between the two versions using two questionnaires (IPQ and NMMoSP), as well as a thematic analysis of the subsequent interview data, from which 5 themes emerged. Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in co-presence or immersion based on the quantitative data. However, the qualitative analysis helps reveal one of the main reasons why that is - maintaining a mental model of the real world while also being in the virtual world makes it harder for the person wearing the headset to immerse themselves and feel co-present. From these themes and sub-themes we theorize that each of the two versions has positives and negatives that cancel each other out in the quantitative data, and for there to be a difference we would need to accentuate or change certain elements of the game. The results show that introducing a second player through a Phone is not detrimental in terms of co-presence and immersion and that it is a viable way of doing so, although certain design considerations would have to be taken into account to minimize the negatives.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"StuckInSpace: Exploring the Difference Between Two Different Mediums of Play in a Multi-Modal Virtual Reality Game","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Similar to last year’s game, this game uses a mechanic that I discovered in Windows that makes for an interesting exerience (although, I only tested it on Windows 10 and some configurations don’t work as well on older versions).\nTo check it out, head over to https://ioiototm.itch.io/the-artifact.\n","date":1613088e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613088e3,"objectID":"d60eea11ed13e8e5fee959eb3e486784","permalink":"https://ioiototm.github.io/project/games/game-jams/the-artifact/","publishdate":"2021-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/games/game-jams/the-artifact/","section":"project","summary":"Southampton Game Jam 2021@Home","tags":["Games","Game Jams","Godot"],"title":"The Artifact","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yoan-Daniel Malinov"],"categories":null,"content":"This was part of the Doctoral Consortium of CHI PLAY in 2020, in which a short summary of the work that was done and the future direction of my PhD was discussed, as well as a short 5 minute video that was presented at the online conference.\n","date":1604361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604361600,"objectID":"a24a6caebf820e5e57e414bd6735c8df","permalink":"https://ioiototm.github.io/publication/chi-play-2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chi-play-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rising popularity of VR technologies, more people are experiencing what this medium has to offer. Right now, the most popular games are either single-player or online-multiplayer, leaving the people in the same room without a way of interacting with the HMD (Head Mounted Display) player. For VR to become mainstream, this problem has to be solved. A preliminary experiment was conducted in which two different ways of including a second person in the VR experience (through a PC or a Phone) were compared in terms of co-presence and immersion. Results showed that both ways are valid and can be used to add a second player --- the quantitative data gathered from two surveys (Networked Minds Measure of Social Presence for co-presence and iGroup Presence Questionnaire for Immersion) showed that there was no significant difference, and the qualitative data, which revealed 13 distinct themes divided into five categories, helped with understanding the survey results. The next steps are to concentrate on one of the categories (embodiment) and conducting a systematic review into ways of increasing it, followed by expert interviews to confirm the findings and create a definitive list of factors that affect embodiment. Finally, a second experiment will be conducted in order to confirm the validity of the factors.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Characterising the Benefits of Multi-Modal Play in Virtual Reality","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This game was created at the beginning of the pandemic, and showcases a couple of mechanics that I find very interesting to use - manipulation of windows and some other tricks that I don’t want to spoil.

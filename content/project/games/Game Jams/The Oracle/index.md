 This game was created at the beginning of the pandemic, and showcases a couple of mechanics that I find very interesting to use - manipulation of windows and some other tricks that I don't want to spoil. Created in Godot, it was my first time using that engine and it's a very lightweight and useful game engine.

You can check out an in-depth description and a download link to play it at its itch.io (available only for Windows, sorry): [https://ioiototm.itch.io/the-oracle](https://ioiototm.itch.io/the-oracle).

I created this game for my research into multi-modality and co-presence in VR - it's heavily inspired by games such as "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes", where the two players have to help eachother defuse a bomb.

StuckInSpace is a two player co-op game where the VR player and the second non-VR player have to help eachother to fix the spaceship. The second player can either use a PC (the normal way) or a smartphone through a novel approach using one of the HTC Vive controllers that sends information about the exact position in VR space to the phone and then renders it like a "window" into the VR world.

Currently there is no way to download the game as I am still working on it, but you can see some screenshots of the game and the hardware setup below:

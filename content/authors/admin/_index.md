Hi there! I'm a PhD student at the University of Southampton who loves exploring new ways of creating immersive and interactive experiences with Virtual Reality (VR). 

My research focuses on how different modes of interactions in VR affect each player's engagement, enjoyment, and sense of presence, and I have published a paper as part of my PhD that you can check in the "Publications" link. 

Outside my research, I am interested in music, as well as game design and development - I have worked on some fun projects that you can check out by clicking the "Projects" link on top. Some of my favourite games are inspired by "I Expect You To Die" and "The Stanley Parable". Welcome to my website!

I'm a PhD student at the University of Southampton. My research area focuses on Virtual Reality (VR) and multi-modality - the different ways of including a second player in a VR game, and how that affects each participant in it. 

I am also interested in Game Design and Development, and have worked on a few small game projects.




You can check my research in the "Research" section above.
I also like games, so I've gone to a few Game Jams and created a few small prototype games, as well as a number of games for a game course I undertook at university and for my research as well. To see the games I have made, check out the "Games" page above.
For other programming projects, you can check "Other projects", which might include more things than programming in the future.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southampton. My PhD is focused on Virtual Reality and multi-modal play - I am interested in the different ways of introducing multiple people to a VR experience without the need for a headset.
